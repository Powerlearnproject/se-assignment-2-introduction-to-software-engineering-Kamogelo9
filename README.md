Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software. It is the application of engineering principles to software development in a methodical way, ensuring that the software is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and scalable.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Traditional Programming: Focuses on writing code to solve specific problems or perform specific tasks. It is often an ad-hoc and isolated activity without much emphasis on the overall system architecture or long-term maintenance.
Software Engineering: Encompasses the entire software development lifecycle, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It considers the broader context of software systems, including integration, scalability, and sustainability.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that defines the stages involved in the development of software applications. Each phase has specific deliverables and processes to ensure the systematic and efficient creation of high-quality software.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements to ensure the final product meets user needs.

Importance:
Provides a foundation for design and development.
Ensures stakeholder satisfaction.
Enhances cost and time efficiency.
Improves communication among stakeholders.


Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
Modularity involves dividing a software system into independent, self-contained units called modules.

Benefits:
Maintainability:

Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module donâ€™t affect others.
Simplified Debugging: Easier to find and fix bugs.
Scalability:

Independent Development: Modules can be developed and deployed independently.
